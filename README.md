# todo-list-v2

The second iteration of the basic todo-list app made using Node.js. The additional features are employing a database in the app. I have used mongoDB Atlas with mongoose for this task. Moreover, the app is hosted using Heroku servers. Enjoy using the app on your local computers from anywhere in the world! :smile:
